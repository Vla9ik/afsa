						<p>
							The AIFC Court and International Arbitration Centre (IAC) have completed more than 900 cases
							consisting of Court
							judgments, arbitration awards, and mediation settlements, since their commencement of operations
							on 1 January 2018.
							These results are unprecedented for dispute resolution institutions at an international
							financial centre which has only
							been operating for four years.
						</p>
						<p>
							The disputes involved a wide range of commercial and investment related matters, including
							finance, construction, sales
							and services contracts, and employment. The applicable laws in the disputes included AIFC law
							and the laws of Kazakhstan
							and Russia. All Court judgments and arbitration awards were enforced within the Republic of
							Kazakhstan to 100%
							satisfaction of the parties using the AIFC Court’s special step by step enforcement procedure
							that operates directly
							between the AIFC Court and the enforcement authorities without involvement of the national
							courts.
						</p>
						<p>
							The AIFC Court and IAC gained significant international recognition in 2021. The parties in the
							cases came from 19
							countries, including most of the CIS countries, and globally from key Republic of Kazakhstan
							trading partners including
							China, India, and 15 Belt and Road Initiative countries as a part of the ‘AIFC Court and IAC BRI
							Initiative’. The AIFC
							Court and IAC model dispute resolution clauses were included in more than 5,700 business
							contracts of industry leaders,
							including Chevron Tengizchevroil LLP and North Caspian Operating Company (NCOC), with combined
							contract value in excess
							of US $2 billion. 326 lawyers from 29 jurisdictions (27 countries) joined the AIFC Court for
							rights of audience to
							enable them to represent clients in cases at the AIFC Court.
						</p>
						<p>
							The AIFC Court participated at the annual Standing International Forum of Commercial Courts
							which comprises Chief
							Justices and Registrars from the senior courts of more than 40 jurisdictions. The AIFC Court and
							IAC gave more than 60
							lead speeches at local, regional and global conferences, including with key AIFC Court and IAC
							MOU partners in Asia and
							Europe as a part of their enhanced promotions campaign. They also hosted the first annual
							IAC-Vis Central Asia Pre-Moot
							competition with 22 teams from 17 countries and a Final that was presided over by the IAC
							Chairman, Barbara Dohmann QC,
							and the fourth annual AIFC Court and IAC Moot Competition and a Final that was presided over by
							three senior AIFC Court
							Justices and opening remarks by the AIFC Court Chief Justice, The Rt. Hon. The Lord Mance.
						</p>
						<p>
							The AIFC Court and IAC continued, as independent self-managed institutions that give final
							decisions which cannot be
							overturned by any court in the Republic of Kazakhstan, continued their close cooperation with
							the Republic of Kazakhstan
							Supreme Court. The cooperation included continued meetings, lectures and training webinars. Of
							particular note was the
							Transfer of Cases Scheme that was agreed between the Supreme Court and the AIFC Court and IAC to
							enable quick and cost
							effective transfer of commercial disputes, with the written consent of the parties in a dispute,
							from the national
							courts of the Republic of Kazakhstan to the AIFC Court and IAC. One case was accepted for
							jurisdiction by the Chief
							Justice of the AIFC Court, Lord Mance, and is currently being considered for judgment by one of
							the AIFC Court Justices.
						</p>
						<p>
							Engagement with the AIFC Court and IAC users’ community continued with three Users’ Committee
							meetings comprising
							representation from the senior partners of more than 15 law firms and other organisations,
							enhanced dispute resolution
							webinars and training programmes attended by more than 1000 people, and structured internships
							for more than 20 law
							students.
						</p>
						<p>
							The AIFC Court and IAC developed their 2025 Vision with plans to further develop the AIFC Court
							and IAC to global elite
							status. The plans focus on stability, growth and recognition. As a part of the plans to achieve
							long term stability, all
							of the judges of the AIFC Court and the Registrar and Chief Executive of the AIFC Court and IAC,
							Mr. Christopher
							Campbell-Holt, committed to continue in their roles at the AIFC Court for another five years,
							securing the AIFC Court’s
							continued long term development as a world class independent and impartial commercial court.
						</p>
						<p>
							To secure the long term future of the IAC, in addition to the continuation of Mr. Campbell-Holt
							as the IAC Registrar and
							Chief Executive, Mr. Thomas Kruemmel was appointed to be the new IAC Chairman from 1 January
							2023. Mr. Kruemmel is an
							IAC Arbitrator Panel member and has many years of international arbitration and mediation
							experience as a global leader
							in the law with specific experience of commercial dispute resolution from Europe, particularly
							in Germany, where he is a
							partner at the law firm Meyer-Koering in Berlin, Germany. He is a member of numerous law
							committees and has law degrees
							from Bonn, Germany, and the University of Glamorgan, Wales. He was awarded the Chevalier dans
							l'ordre national du mérite
							award from France. His appointment as IAC Chairman from 2023 will enhance the IAC’s credentials
							as a world class
							international arbitration centre. The first IAC Chairman, Ms. Barbara Dohmann QC, who has been
							instrumental to the
							establishment and development of the IAC as the number one choice for arbitration and mediation
							disputes in Eurasia,
							will retire from her IAC chairmanship on 31 December 2022.

							<h2 class="post__label">The Rt. Hon. The Lord Mance, Chief Justice of the AIFC Court, commented:
							</h2>
							<blockquote>
								“I am delighted that the AIFC Court has become an active commercial court as it comes to the end
								of its fourth year of
								operations. The AIFC Court has given 21 judgments and has ongoing case work including a range of
								contractual disputes in
								the commercial field. I am particularly pleased that, despite the pandemic, the AIFC Court has
								not been confined to
								remote hearings but has recently heard its first case in its world class premises in Nur-Sultan,
								Kazakhstan. I welcome
								the constitutional arrangement under which the first case has, by consent of the parties to the
								case, been transferred
								from the national courts of the Republic of Kazakhstan to, and has so been dealt with by, the
								AIFC Court. I am also
								grateful to all the other Justices of the Court and to the Registrar and Chief Executive for
								recently renewing their
								commitment to the AIFC Court for another five years. International investors can be confident
								that the world class
								standards of justice provided by the AIFC Court are assured for the future.
							</blockquote>

						<div class="post__quote">
							<h2 class="post__label">Ms. Barbara Dohmann QC, IAC Chairman, stated:
							</h2>
							<blockquote>
								“2021 was another very successful year for the IAC. We had an unprecedented number of
								arbitration awards and mediation
								settlements for a new centre at this stage of its operations. We collaborated successfully with
								arbitrators, mediators,
								and partner ADR institutions from around the world. The IAC provided a large number of webinars
								and training programmes
								on current arbitration and mediation matters, and it generally contributed to the promotion and
								development of
								arbitration and mediation in Eurasia. Investors can take comfort that the long term future of
								the IAC as an independent
								world class arbitration and mediation institution is secure; continuity has been assured by the
								appointment of RA Thomas
								Kruemmel, IAC Arbitrator Panel member and Partner at the internationally focused law firm
								Meyer-Koering in Berlin,
								Germany; I am delighted to say that he will succeed me as IAC Chairman from 1 January 2023”.

							<h2 class="post__label">Dr. Kairat Kelimbetov, AIFC Governor, commented:
							</h2>
							<blockquote>
								“The AIFC Court and IAC have been playing a significant role in the recognition of the AIFC as a
								centre for resolving commercial disputes in the region and enhancing investors’ confidence both
								in the AIFC and mainland Kazakhstan. In this regard, I would like to thank all of the AIFC Court
								judges and the Registrar and Chief Executive of the AIFC Court and IAC for their continued
								commitment to the AIFC. I am also delighted to welcome Mr. Thomas Kruemmel as IAC Chairman
								starting from 2023. I strongly believe that having clarity on the long-term perspectives of the
								AIFC Court and IAC will enhance the positive impact they make on the AIFC and its investment
								climate.”
